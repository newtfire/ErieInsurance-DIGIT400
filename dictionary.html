                            others, bodily injury liability coverage helps pay for the medical
                            expenses of the people (not including you) harmed in the accident. Most
                            states have laws that require you to have bodily injury liability

                            coverage until a permanent policy is issued. For example, when you
                            purchase a new vehicle and you need to call your ERIE Agent to bind
                            coverage until you get the official paperwork complete.</p>

                            renewal date. Typically, you will be given notice explaining the reason

                        <p>Coinsurance, in property insurance terms, requires the policyholder to
                            carry insurance equal to a specified percentage of the value of property
                            to receive full payment on a loss. For health insurance, it’s a
                            percentage of each claim above the deductible paid by the
                            policyholder.</p>

                        <p>Collision coverage helps you cover the costs of repairing or replacing
                            your vehicle after it is damaged in a collision. Most drivers end up
                            paying a deductible, so check your policy or ask your agent to find out
                            what your up-front expense would be. Collision insurance is often
                            required by lenders, but once you own the vehicle, it may be optional.
                            Talk to your agent to find out if collision coverage makes sense for
                            you.</p>

                            vandalism, a falling tree and other things that are covered in your
                            policy. Your auto lender may require you to carry comprehensive on your
                            automobile policy. But once you own the vehicle outright, this coverage
                            is optional.</p>

                        <p>The deductible is how much money you’ll be paying out of pocket before
                            insurance kicks in. Let’s say you crash your car into a tree, causing
                            $1,200 in damages to your car. Your policy has a $500 deductible. That
                            means you would pay the first $500 toward the repair bill and the
                            insurance company would pay for the remaining $700. Many people opt for
                            higher deductible plans in exchange for lower premiums.</p>

                            of your car on an icy road. Your liability will cover the costs of the

                            situations that can keep you from getting where you need to be. If you
                            add road service protection to your auto insurance policy, help is just
                            a phone call away. With it, you can get a tow, a battery jump, help with
                            your tires, gas delivery and more.</p>

                        <p>Subrogation protects you and your insurer from paying for losses that
                            aren’t your fault. It allows your insurer to recoup costs from the
                            at-fault party, including your deductible, if the accident wasn’t your
                            fault.</p>

                        <p>A car is generally considered a total loss when the actual cash value at
                            the time of the loss exceeds the cost of the vehicle’s repair plus its
                            salvage value. Appraisers will estimate the costs of repairs using
                            factors that may differ by state.</p>

                        <p>Let’s say you’re hurt in an automobile accident that was caused by
                            another driver. Ideally, their bodily injury liability policy would have
                            you covered. But what happens if the driver’s policy limits are not high
                            enough to cover the damages to your car, or your injuries? That’s where
                            your underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage kicks in.</p>

                        <p>Similar to underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage, this coverage
                            comes into play when you’re injured in an auto accident caused by
                            someone else. The difference is that the driver either has no insurance
                            or committed a hit-and-run. Because they were at fault and have no
                            insurance to help cover your medical expenses, uninsured motorist bodily
                            injury coverage protects you from having to pay those expenses out of
                            pocket.</p>

                        <p>Underwriting is how an insurance company evaluates its risk of insuring a
                            home, car, driver or person. After looking at the risks involved, an
                            insurance underwriter will set the insurance premium that will be
                            charged in exchange for providing coverage.</p>

                            and year. You can locate your vehicle’s VIN in a number of places: on
